# Preparing Cell Images and Manuall Annotations for YOLOv5

This repo has code to process images in PNG format and their manual annotations of cell positions in SVG format. The program will convert them to image patches with their corresponding text file labels. The program also saves the processed data in the folder order expected by the YOLOv5 framework. This code has been tested with PNG and SVG files exported from Adobe Illustrator 2021.
